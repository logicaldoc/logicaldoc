### [](#header-3)Why may you need a document management system?

The management of your documents is probably one of the most complicated aspects of your business. Many companies produce a lot of documents like PDFs, text documents, reports, tables, pictures and many others. Each worker stores his own documents on his computer and when your business uses some cloud storages, it can be extremely problematic to find the right version of the document with needed information.
 
Often it takes forever to find an important document you need urgently and sometimes a whole document just disappears. Occasionally you find the document you're looking for in 10 different places. But which is the right one? Looking for an answer can consume a lot of your precious time.
